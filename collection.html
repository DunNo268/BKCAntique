                    Name: An Interesting Large Framed Collection Of Victorian Pratt Ware Pot Lids<br><br>
                    Description:<br>
                    This highly decorative large finely framed collection of Victorian Pratt Ware pot lids represents an interesting view into Victorian life. Amongst the 35 pieces on display, there are views depicting various famous buildings, prominent people of the day, country houses, people at their daily chores, horse racing, fishing and multiple other subjects. They are produced in vibrant colours showing great detail. The Pratt ware factory was renowned for this quality. They have been mounted into a purpose made giltwood mount which is displayed in a fine well detailed moulded swept giltwood frame. All pieces date to the Victorian period. Most are in good condition, a few have some damage as shown in the photographs. This unusual and impressive framed collection will have a good visual impact and create great interest on the wall.<br>
                    Circa 1880<br>
                    Robert Belcher Antiques is a high quality antiques shop, which also offers picture framing and restoration services. The company is based in Droitwich Spa, the medieval Worcestershire town made famous by salt production.<br>
                    The business is run by husband and wife team, Robert and Wendy Belcher, and has been established since 1984. The show rooms are situated in a detached Georgian double fronted town house, which has a private forecourt for the benefit of customer parking.<br>
                    The M5 motorway means access is convenient, as the show rooms are located only 3 miles off Junction 6. The business can be found half a mile prior to reaching Droitwich Spa town centre on the main A38 road. If using a SAT-NAV, please use the post code WR9 8AN.<br>
                    Robert Belcher sources a range of interesting stock both nationally and internationally. The stock is always of a high quality and Robert prides himself on the authenticity and excellence of all items held for sale.<br>
                    The business specialises in fine 18th century and early 19th century town furniture mainly in Walnut and Mahogany, which is displayed in the four showrooms. The showrooms also contain an interesting mix of rare objects and interesting, decorative items that would complement most collections or interiors.<br><br>

                    Name: 19thc Gilt Cast Brass Eagle From The Personal Collection Of Belinda Gentle<br><br>
                    Description:<br>
                    Mid 19th century gilt cast brass eagle and wood stand, from the personal collection of Belinda Gentle, internationally renowned antiques dealer and an acknowledged expert on antique metalwork. Her husband Rupert, was the author of Domestic Metalwork, the authoritative book on the subject, which she updated and revised after his death.<br>
                    The Belinda Gentle metalware gallery at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is named after her. She was a lifetime student and dealer in antique brass and associated metalwork.<br>
                    This was purchased from her home in 2005 after she died.<br>
                    The eagle with original gilding, is very realistically cast, with spread wings, turned head, and open claws. It comes with a black painted wood stand, which bears the label underneath from the sale of her effects.<br>

                    In very good condition, this is a truly lovely piece from the private collection of an international expert on the subject.<br><br>
